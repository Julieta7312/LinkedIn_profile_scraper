# Python program to scrape LinkedIn user profiles

This scraper can be used to retrieve information about employment, education, and honors and awards -related information from the publically available Linkedin user profiles.

Information on other profile sections can be retrieved as well by simply adding more functions while referring to the structure and input arguments for the already defined functions (i.e. the functions for fetching employment, education, and honors and awards -related data).
